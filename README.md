# CallRecorder
Automatic Phone Call Recorder for Android

An automatic phone call recorder, records ALL calls your phone gets. You can choose to not record some of your contacts, or you can record every call. Schedule
recording cleanup and mark recordings to never be deleted (by the cleanup schedule).

It's up to you to determine if this is legal in your jurisdiction. Not every phone supports call recording, so your mileage may very.
